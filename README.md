Playing around streams


### What am I trying to achieve on the hack day?
1. Learn basics of GRASS from @maning 
2. Use ASTER GDEM(30m resolution) to derive ordered streams of a watershed using GRASS.
3. Process it and exporting it to geoJSON using QGIS.
4. Import the geoJSON files on to Studio as tilesets.
5. Customise to create visually appealing map with help of @planemad 
6. Use Mapbox GL JS to create a web app (possibly with few interactivity).
